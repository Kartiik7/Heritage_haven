    "description": "An immense mausoleum of white marble, the Taj Mahal was built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife.

    "description": "Located in the centre of Rome, Italy, the Colosseum is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built. Constructed of travertine limestone, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators. For centuries, it was used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, animal hunts, and dramas based on Roman mythology. Despite being partially ruined by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum remains an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is one of the world's most popular tourist attractions.",

Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, itâ€™s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar. The exact former use of Machu Picchu remains a mystery, but its intricate agricultural terraces, plazas, and temples suggest it was a sacred or royal estate. The site's stunning preservation and breathtaking mountain backdrop make it one of the most famous archaeological wonders in the world.",
