**Problem Statement:** Heritage lovers struggle to find consolidated, reliable details on monuments, their history, and nearby services — everything is scattered across multiple apps and websites. Planning an itinerary combining multiple sites is time-consuming and complex, with no intelligent tools to optimize routes or discover hidden gems. The gap is clear: there's no unified, intelligent platform designed specifically for cultural tourism in India.

**Tech Stack:** React.js, Node.js, Express.js, CSS, natural.js, MongoDB

**Explore India's rich heritage like never before!** Heritage Haven India is a web platform, built for the **[DevCreate BuildFest 1.0]** hackathon, that transforms the way we discover and experience India's magnificent cultural treasures. We go beyond static images and text, offering a dynamic, immersive, and personalized journey through history.
